# Operational Research On Establishing Coffee  Shop Network
## Introduction 
In this project we take Linear Programming and build a mathematical model in order to optimize the costs of different aspects of establishing a Coffee Shop Network. 
We use Lindo Program in order to solve the linear programming model which we have built.

## Course
The course project is Deterministic Models and is done under the Industrial Engineering Department in Ariel University. The course consists of  13 meetings where in each meeting we learn deterministic mathematical models such as Linear Programming , Dijkstra  and  The Hungarian Algorithm in order to reach an optimal solution to different problems.
